# Weather Dashboard

# Description:

Description of project: Create a Weather Dashboard that displays the current weather conditions along with the five day forecast.

## Completed Tasks

* When the user searches for a city, the user is presented with the current weather information.

* When I view current weather conditions for that city, then  I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. (uv index not completed :(  )


* When I view future weather conditions for that city,
then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
